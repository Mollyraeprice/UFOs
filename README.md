# UFOs

## Overview of Project
#### This challenge was testing our ability to build an application with filters by creating tables in vs code on our app.js file. We were tasked with organizing data using a JavaScript array. This filter would need to load specfic info from our dataset. We used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and Bootstrap to organize and display the info with filters. 

## Results 
####  Below is the first thing you see when you land on Dana's new website.

#### Here is an example of what using the date filter looks like:

#### Here is an example of using the 'shape filer':

You can clearly see all of the info displayed after using the filter. 

## Summary
#### On drawback of the new design is the need to know the specifics of the filters. What if you didn't know that 'teardrop' is a shape? There are also too many cities to remember. It is also a bit touchy. Say you put in 'circl' instead of 'circle' as we had earlier:

#### As you can see, there isn't any room for error. This also applies to the style you write the date, or even capitilzation of cities.
 
### Recommendations
#### I think there could be a way to allow mistakes or accidental capitilizations in the filter system. That way, the info intended will still be displayed for the user. I also think that when someone types in 'circle', there could be similar shapes (sphere, disk) that also pop up after a headline of 'Futher Results' pops up above it. 

: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
